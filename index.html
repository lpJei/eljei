                <h4 class="sub">Soft Skills</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drawing</li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I do study sketches and fan arts of my favorite media (e.g., favorite animated films) on either sketchbook/ paper, or in my laptop using a graphic tablet. 
                            For the past few years of drawing as a hobby, this also became a skill. One use was me competing for poster-making events when I was in high school.
                        </p>
                    <li>Taekwondo</li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Started as a hobby, learning Taekwondo became a very huge milestone for me.
                            Aside from helping me become fit, I met new people and was encouraged to joined competitions.
                            I got multiple scholarships and sponsorships that helped me continue my journey.
                            Now, I got to represent my school. From that, I won multiple awards, received incentives, and gain recognition from the campus.
                            Most of all, the sport taught me to work even harder for my goals.
                        </p>
                    <li>Computer proficiency</li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I had to learn how to be computer-proficient, mainly because I am currently taking a computer-related course.
                            Aside from that, becoming computer-proficient helped me manage my time and learned how to use technology to maximize
                            its potential into helping me do computer-related tasks and programming-related activities.
                            I am still on the level of learning, but I can say that I already have some set of skills.
                        </p>
                    <li>Programming/ coding</li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Aside from learning to use computers to become computer-proficient, I also learned how to use HTML when I was in JHS, and Java/ MySQL when I was in my SHS days.
                            Now, we're taught different programming languages such as PHP, Python, and C++.
                            But then, I only know basic syntaxes, but I'm on my way learning front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        </p>

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I do my best to contribute to my group, and that means opening myself for communication and collaboration, because
                            I believe that participation and active listening are key to a successful project. Aside from that, I also share my insights and perspective
                            for the group to make mutual decisions and settle an agreement within.
                        </p>
                    <li>Attention to detail</li>
                        <p class="paragraph">
                            Whether a project is small, one must ensure organization and accuracy. Anything that needs submitting is thoroughly
                            checked to make sure there are no typographical errors, missing details, and the whole document is neatly organized.
                            I always condition myself to double-check everything, this includes arranging things, re-reading papers, checking whether
                            the stove's gas valve is closed, and checking for cracks and small dents. The same mindset I apply with my academic works.
